This repository contains test cases and examples for the "Fundamentos da Programação" projects conducted during the academic year 23-24.

## Project 1: Montanhas e Vales

### Description

In this first "Fundamentos da Programação" project, students will develop functions that allow obtaining some information about the state of a rectangular territory formed by vertical and horizontal paths. The intersections of the paths in a territory may or may not be occupied by mountains and form chains of mountains and valleys.
